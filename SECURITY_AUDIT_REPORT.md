# Security Audit Report - SafeEscape Backend

## Executive Summary
This report documents the security audit conducted on the SafeEscape backend application, identifying critical security vulnerabilities and providing fixes for each issue.

## Critical Security Issues Identified

### 1. **CRITICAL: Missing JWT Secret Environment Variable**
**Severity**: Critical
**Location**: `middleware/auth/auth.js:10`
**Issue**: The application uses `process.env.JWT_SECRET` without validation, which could cause authentication failures if the environment variable is not set.
**Risk**: Authentication bypass, application crashes

### 2. **HIGH: Overly Permissive CORS Configuration**
**Severity**: High
**Location**: `server.js:72`, `server-core.js:37`, `bot/app.js:16`
**Issue**: CORS is configured with `origin: '*'` allowing any domain to make requests
**Risk**: Cross-origin attacks, data theft

### 3. **HIGH: Missing Input Validation**
**Severity**: High
**Location**: Multiple route handlers
**Issue**: No input validation on request bodies, params, or query parameters
**Risk**: Injection attacks, data corruption

### 4. **HIGH: Unsafe JSON.parse() Usage**
**Severity**: High
**Location**: Multiple files including `config/firebase-config.js:23`
**Issue**: JSON.parse() used without try-catch blocks in several places
**Risk**: Application crashes, DoS attacks

### 5. **MEDIUM: Missing Rate Limiting**
**Severity**: Medium
**Location**: Server configuration
**Issue**: No rate limiting implemented despite express-rate-limit being installed
**Risk**: DoS attacks, resource exhaustion

### 6. **MEDIUM: Information Disclosure in Error Messages**
**Severity**: Medium
**Location**: `server.js:254`, error handlers
**Issue**: Detailed error messages exposed in production
**Risk**: Information leakage

### 7. **MEDIUM: Insecure File Upload Configuration**
**Severity**: Medium
**Location**: `bot/app.js:30`, `routes/aiRoutes.js:4`
**Issue**: File uploads without proper validation and sanitization
**Risk**: Malicious file uploads, path traversal

### 8. **LOW: Excessive Console Logging**
**Severity**: Low
**Location**: Multiple files
**Issue**: Sensitive information logged to console
**Risk**: Information disclosure in logs

## Dependency Vulnerabilities
âœ… **FIXED**: All npm audit vulnerabilities have been resolved by running `npm audit fix`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Environment Variable Validation
Created a comprehensive environment validation system.

### 2. Secure CORS Configuration
Implemented environment-specific CORS settings.

### 3. Input Validation Middleware
Added comprehensive input validation.

### 4. Rate Limiting Implementation
Configured rate limiting for API endpoints.

### 5. Secure Error Handling
Implemented secure error responses.

### 6. File Upload Security
Enhanced file upload validation and sanitization.

### 7. Logging Security
Implemented secure logging practices.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. Set up proper environment variables for all deployments
2. Configure CORS for specific allowed origins
3. Implement comprehensive input validation
4. Add rate limiting to all API endpoints
5. Review and sanitize all error messages

### Long-term Security Improvements:
1. Implement API authentication for all endpoints
2. Add request/response encryption
3. Set up security monitoring and alerting
4. Regular security audits and penetration testing
5. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
